  "version" : "1.2.1",
  "description" : "* Added a new openBackground option for URL Actions. This lets URLs open in the background without the app taking focusâ€”perfect for automation workflows.\n* Clipboard restoration now has a delay of 0.3 seconds instead of the previous 0.1, to prevent paste issues.\n\nYou'll likely need to re-grant accessibility permissions after updating. All changes are backward compatible, so your existing configuration will continue working."
