# Macrowhisper

This repository contains **Macrowhisper**, a set of Keyboard Maestro macros designed to extend Superwhisper's functionality by enabling actions after dictation processing. All individual macros are in the `MW` folder.

This repository provides access to the latest releases. You can track releases using GitHub notifications or by subscribing to the releases RSS feed at  
`https://github.com/ognistik/macrowhisper/releases.atom`. 

Feel free to report issues here if you encounter any.

*Each release contains the entire macro group, which is ideal for new users. If you have customized your macros, you can check the release notes to see if a specific macro was updated and get just that updated macro from the `MW` folder. The repository always has the latest versions, so you donâ€™t need to re-download the whole group when only one macro has changed.*
